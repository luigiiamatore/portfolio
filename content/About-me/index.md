title: About me
---

**Backend Software Engineer** with an **MSc in Computer Science** from **Università degli Studi di Milano** (2025). I studied graph theory and algorithmic complexity—my thesis on the **Weisfeiler-Lehman test**, done at **AWLAB** under **Prof. Paolo Boldi**, is something I'm genuinely proud of.

Started job-coding during my studies at **Astir** as a **full-stack developer**, but I've increasingly focused on backend systems. Now at **Retail Reply** working with **Salesforce Commerce Cloud**—building robust integrations that actually matter to businesses.

I've also lived a bit: did **Erasmus+ in Warsaw**, spent three months in Japan working remotely while traveling. Those experiences taught me how to work independently and stay productive anywhere. I'm also part of **ESN La Statale**, where I help organize events and am currently working towards becoming IT Manager.

I care about writing code that's simple to understand, systems that scale, and working with people who think clearly.
